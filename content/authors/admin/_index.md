Dr. Chaogui Kang is an associate professor of Geographic Information Science at [Wuhan University](http://www.whu.edu.cn), and currently a visiting scholar at [New York University's Center for Urban Science + Progress](http://cusp.nyu.edu). He was trained in Geography, Data Science, Complex Network, and is leading a dynamic research group – [Urban CoLab @ Wuhan University](http://urbancolab.com) – with the mission to develop data-driven, human-centric, and cross-cutting methodologies for tackling urban problems from a geospatial perspective. His primary research interest lies in the interplay of Travel Behavior, Built Environment and Social Inequality with the assistance of pervasive urban sensing techniques.

Dr. Chaogui Kang graduated in Geographic Information Science from [Nanjing University](http://www.nju.edu.cn) (BSc) and [Peking University](http://www.pku.edu.cn) (PhD with Honor). He was also visiting scholar and research affiliate in [SENSEable City Lab](http://senseable.mit.edu.cn) at [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](http://www.mit.edu.cn), and had held a joint position as research associate in [Department of Land Surveying and Geo-Informatics](http://www.lsgi.polyu.edu.hk/) at [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University](http://www.polyu.edu.hk). In his spare time, he enjoys swimming, playing badminton and basketball.
